Hello World!

I am Sandeep Kumar Behera. I am currently working at Apple in the Special Project Group aka SPG. 
I work on and have a passion for optimizing the performance of Deep Learning applications at large scale for Training and Inference. 

Not clear? Let me put it this way -

If you are Training or Deploying DL models on 100s or 1000s of GPUs and worried about running the applications efficiently. Then I am the person who 
can help you get the best ROI.

I have done my Masters in Computer Engineer with specialization in Computer Architecture. After graduating I joined Nvidia where I designed and architected
features in Pascal, Maxwel, Volta and Turing generations of GPU. I was then caught by the ML bug. I wanted to do delve into ML but still be able to use the GPU 
knowledge and expertise that I had gained over the years. That's when I decided to try performance optimization which is the perfect intersection of both.
After Nvidia I worked briefly at Uber ATG where I got introduced to the world of Autonomous Vehicles. 
Now, I am at Apple!

Outside of work, I love -
* Going on long walks with my wife
* Playing with my daughter
* Running
* Reading books

Cheers!
